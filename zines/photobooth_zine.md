After a chance run-in at a minigolf course in Lincolnwood, I started trying to track down all of the analog photo booths that were still operating in Chicago. That labor of love turned into this fun little zine! Now on its fourth edition, it boasts 24 full-color pages (including front and back cover) with original illustrations, collages, and diagrams, and includes a map of all the analog photo booths in Chicago that I've been able to identify.

The first edition was an experimental project printed on a Risograph printer. Editions two and three were printed at a copy shop and hand-stapled. Edition four has been entirely redesigned and professionally printed, and looks very handsome!

You can buy this zine at [several stores in Chicago]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link buy.md %}), or directly from me, or get a digital version [here](https://charliequebecsierra.gumroad.com).
