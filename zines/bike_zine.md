This is my first zine, which I created in 2023 for a digital design class. I'm an avid cyclist, and I was inspired by a class conversation we had about the percieved difficulties of using a bike as your main mode of transportation. This zine challenges experienced and novice bikers alike to think creatively about things such as how to prepare for inclement weather of all types, hauling large and small loads, and long-distance touring.

The zine is 20 pages in black and white with highlighter-yellow accents, and features hand-drawn illustrations throughout. It was printed on an office printer and stapled by hand. It was distributed for free, and is no longer in print.
