# Analog Photo Booth Locations in Chicago

<p>
I write a zine called "A Little Guide to Analog Photo Booths in Chicago". Sometimes the locations of the booths change before I'm able to print and distribute a new edition. You can find an Airtable view below that I keep up-to-date with the most current location information that I have.

### Frequently Asked Questions

#### Where do you source this information?
I've been hunting down analog booths as a hobby since 2023. I personally visit and use each booth I hear about so I can take notes about things like how to find it, how much it costs, and so I can snap a photo of it for the zine.

#### How often do you check to make sure the booths are still at these locations?
Not very often! That's why I welcome you to email me at photoboothzine@gmail.com to let me know if you see that one has moved, or if you think you've discovered a new one. Luckily, most of the booths are owned by the same company[^1], so I will sometimes see updates on their Instagram.

#### Are you associated with any of these businesses, or with the people that own the photo booths?
Nope! I'm just some guy[^2].

[^2]: "guy", in the gender-neutral sense.

#### Can I share this page with other people?
Sure, I don't see why not. I would love it if you bought my zine for them, too! It has a lot of other fun things apart from just the booth locations. You can find out how to buy it [here]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link buy.md %}).
