### Hi! I'm Charlie.

I live in Chicago, and I use they/them pronouns.

As a multidisciplinary artist, I'm most inspired by finding the places where dated analog machinery and digital technology can overlap. I take a "DIY" approach to art, and I enjoy finding creative ways to reuse materials in my work.


### Here are some things I'm interested in:
* Teaching people how things work
* Biking
* Vegetable gardening
* Public transit
* Public libraries
* People-centered urban infrastructure
* Psychology
* Native plants
* Recycling and eco-friendly reuse
* Interesting stories
* Sour gummy worms
